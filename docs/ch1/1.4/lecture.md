# Ch1.4 Overview

## Account Model vs UTXO Model

Account model (Ethereum) :
- A global mapping of `accounts -> balances`
- Sends reduce one accountâ€™s balance and increase another account's balance
- Easy to understand
- Easy to count and measure (wallets, dApps, etc...)
- Allows for double spends and replay attacks if you're not careful

UTXO model (Bitcoin)
- Every send must include the entire account balance.
- Sends can specify multiple recipients.
- Sends can originate from multiple senders.
- Transactions depend on a specific set of unspent outputs (thus double spends are impossible because once spent there's new UTXOs and old ones are invalid)
- Because double spends are impossible and dependencies are explicit, ordering does not matter so transactions can be processed in parallel
- Can be complex to create wallets and infrastructure around this architecture

> Neither the Account model or the UTXOs model are privacy preserving on their own! Just because the numbers/letters of addresses look funny to you does not mean that a computer programmer, crypto-currency exchange, or data scientist can't trace blockchain addresses to real world identities. The only purely private way to send transactions is with a cryptocurrency that uses zero knowledge proofs like ([zcash](https://z.cash)).
