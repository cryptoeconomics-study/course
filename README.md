2. 📙**[Book](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study/book)**  - writing content for the accompanying book, "Cryptoeconomics: an Introduction". 
3. 👾**[Code](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study/code)** - prototyping JS implementations of protocols + attacks covered in lectures.
4. ⛓**[Chainshot Content](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study/chainshot-content)** - polishing up the prototypes from the `code` repo into lessons hosted on Chainshot (writeups, starter code, solutions, tests).
5. 🕹**[Visualizations](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study/visualizations)** - building interactive network visualizations of consensus protocols and attacks.
