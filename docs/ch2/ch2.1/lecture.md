# Ch2.1 Overview 

Synchronous networks
- messages will arrive within a given time

Partially synchronous networks
- messages will arrive, but we don't know when

Asynchronous networks
- we do not know if or when messages will arrive

# STUDENT QUESTIONS


In decentralized networks do messages always get processed right away?
- No. We have no idea if or when messages will arrive. This is one of the challenges in designing decentralized networks.

What is a synchronous network model?
- one in which there is an upper bound on how long it will take a message to be sent and delivered

What is a partially synchronous network model?
- there is an upper bound on how long it will take messages to be delivered, but we don't know what that upper bound is

What is an asynchronous network model?
- we do not know if or when messages will arrive
