We go over some common pitfalls of building systems which do not account for particularly nasty failure modes--system faults, monopoly pricing, censorship, & fraud. With cryptoeconomics we can make sure these bad things don't happen!

# Ch1.5 Overview

* Properties of centralized systems
   * Benefits:
      * Easy to build and reason about.
      * Simple to scale.
      * Privacy preserving. (if you trust the operator)
   * Downsides:
      * Single point of failure
         * If the operator is removed (eg. servers burn down, servers seized by authorities), the entire system breaks.
      * Censorship
         * The operator can censor users and change their balances, and it is very difficult for users to prove malfeasance.
            * This is because there is no client-side validation
      * Fraud
         * Because the operator has complete control, they can steal money directly from users.
         * The only safeguard against this kind of misbehavior is the legal system & social reputation.
            * Even these threats are not enough--see Bitconnect, Mt. Gox, and many other exchanges which have been hacked.
            * Also, theft is often unprovable
   * These downsides limit what can be built on top of these systems.
      * Clearly no illegal securities!
* Letâ€™s decentralize :)
