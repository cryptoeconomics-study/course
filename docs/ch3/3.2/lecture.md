# Ch3.2 Overview

In a decentralized network anyone can join. We need a way to choose who gets to validate transactions and submit blocks. Randomly choosing nodes doesn't work because it's cheap to create lots of nodes to overwhelm the network. We need something expensive and hard to obtain. This is the "work" part of Proof of Work. Nodes need to solve a computationally hard puzzle which takes time and energy to solve. When nodes solve the puzzle they can then use this proof of this work to the network in order to be able to submit the next block on the chain. Because it takes time and energy to solve these puzzles, there is a cost to doing so. There are also rewards for correctly solving puzzles and creating valid blocks, so people like to play this game.

Over time people have develop specialized hardware to just solve these computational puzzles. These computers are much much better at this than normal CPUs, but they're not really good at anything else. These computers are called Application Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs. They are specialized computers chips that are designed to compute transaction as fast and efficiently as possible. It helps to think of these things are cars. ASICS are Lamborghinis in terms of speed and power. They can compute transactions faster. They are not cheap to acquire so their distribution is not equal to the distribution to other cars. The most basic car everyone has is the CPUs. Pretty much every one has this. Gamers and those that desire a better car use GPUs. Much faster then CPUs. Others looking even better car look to FGPAs. The ones with the most speed and power (currency) are ASCIS. Check out the graph below to see this evolution of mining hardware
