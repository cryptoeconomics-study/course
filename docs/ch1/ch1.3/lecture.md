# Ch1.3 Overview

* Account model vs UTXO model
   * Briefly cover the differences
   * Account model (what we are using for our implementation):
      * A global mapping of `account->balance`
      * Sends reduce one accountâ€™s balance and increase another account's balance
   * UTXO model (unspent transaction output model used in Bitcoin)
      * Same as the account model, however with three added rules:
         * 1) Every send must include the entire account balance.
         * 2) Sends can specify multiple recipients.
         * 3) Sends can originate from multiple senders.
   * Supposed to be privacy preserving, but these days the privacy can be broken. Only purely private way to send is zero knowledge proofs.
