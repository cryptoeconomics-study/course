# Ch3.5 Overview

Selfish mining is a strategy to try to decrease the economic rewards of other miners on the network while increasing your own rewards. This is done by mining a valid block, then withholding it and trying to mine another block on top. If you see that someone else mined a valid block release your valid block to potentially invalidate their block and decrease their rewards. If you don't see another valid block keep mining on yours until you get another block. Then once someone releases a block you release both of yours, and since you have the longest chain yours is the valid fork. This makes other miners spend time and energy computing blocks without gaining any rewards. If you recycle your rewards into more mining power, eventually, theoretically, you will eventually have all the hash power on the network.

As far as we know, this has not happened yet. The main reason is that it is very expensive. Bitcoin has value because people think it is censorship resistant and secure. Because it's valuable to users and the price of Bitcoin is high, miners invest money in specialized mining computers. These computers (ASICs) are only good at mining Bitcoin, so they can't be resold for any other purpose. If someone used their mining power to overrun the network, then it would no longer be valuable for users, which would make the price of Bitcoin drop, which would make the mining hardware useless, which would make the selfish miner lose a lot of money.
