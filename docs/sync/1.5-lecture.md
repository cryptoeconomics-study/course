# Properties of Centralized Systems
- We go over some common pitfalls of building systems which do not account for particularly nasty failure modes--system faults, monopoly pricing, censorship, & fraud. With cryptoeconomics we can make sure these bad things don't happen!

# Ch1.5 Overview

## Benefits:
- Easy to build and reason about.
- Simple to scale.
- Semi Privacy preserving. (only the operator has your data)

## Downsides:
- Single point of failure
 - If the operator is removed (eg. servers burn down, servers seized by authorities), the entire system breaks.
- Censorship
 - The operator can censor users and change their balances, and it is very difficult for users to prove malfeasance. This is because there is no client-side validation
- Fraud
 - Because the operator has complete control, they can steal money directly from users.
 - The only safeguard against this kind of misbehavior is the legal system & social reputation. Even these threats are not enough--see Bitconnect, Mt. Gox, and many other exchanges which have been hacked. Also, theft is often unprovable
- These downsides limit what can be built on top of these systems.
	- Regulation and bureaucracy dictate the speed of innovation

## Letâ€™s decentralize :)

Yay blockchains
