# Ch2.2 Overview 

Double Spend
- A double spend is when someone tries to broadcast two transactions that both spend the same account balance. This can be the result of simply sending a transaction again because it's not being processed, or trying to spend money you don't have. Because blockchains operate in an asynchronous environment, we never if/when messages will be processed. To prevent double spends we use things like [nonces](../../ch1/ch1.3/lecture) to determine which messages to process and which to discard. This is important to ensure that everyone on the network agrees on the shared state of the network.
