ASICS and Client Side Validation

The problem is compounded when you think about ASICS. ASICS stand for Application Specific Integrated Circuits. They are specialized computers chips that are designed to compute transaction as fast and efficiently as possible. It helps to think of these things are cars. ASICS are Lamborghinis in terms of speed and power. They can compute transactions faster. They are not cheap to acquire so their distribution is not equal to the distribution to other cars. The most basic car everyone has is the CPUs. Pretty much every one has this. Gamers and those that desire a better car use GPUs. Much faster then CPUs. Others looking even better car look to FGPAs. The ones with the most speed and power (currency) are ASCIS. Check out the graph below to see this evolution of minning hardware
