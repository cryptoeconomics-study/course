# Ch3.3 Overview

Merkle Trees
- A hash of a hash of a hash of a hash... of all the data until there's just 1 hash - the "root" of the tree. A guy named Ralph Merkle invented this as a data structure.

Merkle Proof / Branch
- The set of hashes in a merkle tree necessary to verify that a piece of data is within the merkle tree. This allows you to verify the integrity of a piece of data within a data set by checking much less than the full set of data. This is what light clients on Ethereum or Bitcoin do.
