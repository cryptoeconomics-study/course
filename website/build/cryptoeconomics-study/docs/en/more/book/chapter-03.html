<p>There are many types of proof of work: memory hard, cpu hard. At its core, proof of work is a difficult puzzle that requires a costly expenditure in pursuit of a prize.</p>
<p>There are certain properties that we look for in decentralized consensus.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Censorship resistance: Everyone’s transactions will be included.</p></li>
<li><p>Reversion resistance: There is a single history that cannot be changed, and the past cannot be modified or rewritten.</p></li>
<li><p>Robustness: the consensus engine (ie blockchain) will not go offline or halt.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at Proof of Work and examine how it achieves these three properties.</p>

<p>When a block of transactions is mined, a block reward is dispersed to the successful miner. In order to mine a block, there is a special puzzle that must be solved.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at MuskCoin. In this case, the puzzle is a lock that requires an Elon Musk shaped chicken nugget to open.</p>
<p>You cannot tell what the shape of the nugget will be simply by looking at the chicken. So in order to create this Elon Nugget, many chickens are turned in to nuggets.</p>
<p>The goal is to make the puzzle hard enough so that only one Elon-shaped nugget is found every ten minutes. However, the more miners are turning chickens into nuggets, and the more chickens that are being thrown at the puzzle, the easier it will be to find such a nugget.</p>
<p>If it so happens that it becomes quite popular to mine MuskCoin, and an Elon-shaped nugget is being found every 2 minutes instead of every 10 minutes, MuskCoin will readjust the puzzle difficulty to require that the nugget resemble a 1998 Elon in order to make the parameters of the puzzle are much harder to solve.</p>
<p>Oh no! Now, Elon-shaped nuggets are being found every 20 minutes. This is too infrequent! The target difficulty is every 10 minutes. So, MuskCoin readjusts the parameters to allow the nugget to resemble a 90's Elon - a nugget shaped in Elon anywhere in that decade, rather than specifically an Elon from the year 1998.</p>

<p>There are many types of proof of work. For example, cpu-bound, memory-bound.</p>
<p>CPU-hard proof of work: Hashcash
Hashcash was originally invented to reduce email spam. Email senders can generate a hashcash stamp to include in the header of their email. Hashcash requires CPU to compute, and for users who send or receive a normal (non-spammer number) of emails, the cost of generating and validating these stamps is negligible. But for spammers, this becomes a substantial disincentive.</p>
<p>Memory-hard proof of work: Cuckoo Cycle
Cuckoo cycle PoW is memory bound graph theoretic proof of work. Finds length 42 cycle in a graph. Pros: greener. Cons: takes more header space and is slower. A majority of the runtime is memory latency.
Read more: <a href="https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo">https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo</a></p>
<p>The simplest form of PoW would be using a hash function over and over to generate a hash with some number of leading zeros.</p>
<p>6 leading 0’s: hash(block_msg) == <code>0x000000abcdef123456789</code></p>
<p>Sample implementation: <a href="https://github.com/karlfloersch/lessons/blob/master/lessons/02_proofOfWork.js#L16-L26">https://github.com/karlfloersch/lessons/blob/master/lessons/02_proofOfWork.js#L16-L26</a></p>
<p>The more leading zeros, the more work you have to do (computation).</p>
<p>The amount of work that is done on a chain is considered the number of “votes” that chain has. Because there is a limited amount of computation in the world, that means there is a limited number of votes, which means we are able to form a single longest chain. The work also acts as a rate limiting mechanism so that blocks are not created faster than clients can download or validate.</p>
<p>The more leading zeroes there are, the more work/ computation you have to do. This computation fills the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voting: The votes (for the de facto chain) are determined by the amount of computation done on the chain.</li>
<li>Rate limiting: The work acts as a rate limiting mechanism so that blocks are not created faster than clients can download or validate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fork choice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In proof of authority, we didn’t have to worry so much about forks because the authorities probably wouldn’t create a fork intentionally. However, in proof of work because anyone can participate forking will naturally occur.</p></li>
<li><p>With multiple forks, users are going to have to agree on which fork to follow. This is called the “fork choice rule”.</p></li>
<li><p>In the simplest proof of work, we can use the “longest chain” fork choice rule. If we have two forks, we compare which one is longer and choose that one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is a fork?</strong></p>
<p>A normal fork is when a blockchain splits into two. As discussed in Chapter 0, there are unintentional forks, when miners expend work on different blocks. If these two miners find PoW solutions within a short time of each other, and propagate their respective new blocks to the network, some nodes will receive the information that the blockchain now includes the newly discovered block from Miner 1, whereas others will receive the information broadcasted by Miner 2. Now, two different chains exist and a fork is created. However, in this case, Miner 1 and Miner 2 are still following the same blockchain consensus rules so this fork will be resolved quickly. Even if the network is perfectly split and exactly half the network continues to build on the block found by Miner 1 and the rest build on the block found by Miner 2, one chain will eventually have a block mined faster than the other. Then, all miners will converge back onto the chain with the most cumulative work in order to continue earning rewards from the de facto chain.</p>
<p>A hard fork is caused when new consensus rules are created, and some nodes upgrade to follow those rules, but other nodes choose not to upgrade and continue to follow the original consensus rules. This creates a permanent divergence in the blockchain. Case study: bitcoin and bitcoin cash.</p>
<p>A soft fork is backwards-compatible and still allows nodes that follow old consensus rules to come on to the new chain. Whereas hard forks are strictly opt-in, because they require users to update software to participate, a soft fork does not require this.</p>
<p>In proof of authority, we didn’t have to worry so much about forks because the authorities probably wouldn’t create a fork intentionally. However, in proof of work because anyone can participate forking will naturally occur.</p>
<p>With multiple forks, users are going to have to agree on which fork to follow. This is called the “fork choice rule”.</p>
<p>In the simplest proof of work, we can use the “longest chain” fork choice rule. If we have two forks, we compare which one is longer and choose that one.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty &amp; difficulty adjustment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Difficulty -- The more zeros in a row, the more hashes you have to compute/work you have to do. Intuitively you can think of how much longer it takes to flip a coin and get heads once, vs flip a coin and get heads 10 times in a row.</p></li>
<li><p>Difficulty adjustment -- In order to target a particular blocktime (eg. 1 block every 10 minutes) we adjust the number of zeros the computers need to compute to create a new block. So if we find a whole bunch of blocks very quickly with a difficulty of finding 3 zeros in a row, then the protocol will say “ok now find hashes with 4 zeros in a row” and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>With difficulty adjustment we need to adjust our “longest chain” fork choice rule to be “highest difficulty chain”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reversions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A reversion or “reorg” happens when we choose a new chain which doesn’t include all blocks from our previous chain.</p></li>
<li><p>This is scary! Transactions which we believed to have occured may no longer be valid. This means if you received a payment, there is a chance will be “reverted”.</p></li>
<li><p>In proof of work, blocks are less likely to be reorged out of the chain the deeper they are in the chain. For instance, if a block is 20 blocks deep in the chain, we can assume that it is probably going to be included in the history going forward, assuming no extraordinary circumstances.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For illustrative purposes, let’s make some assumptions regarding an attacker’s resources and then compute the likelihood of a reorg. Let’s say an attacker has 40% of the total hash power in the network and wants to revert a transaction six blocks deep. In order for the attacker to win, they must build the longest chain starting from that block. The main chain is already 6 blocks longer than what the attacker is starting with - the likelihood that the attacker will be able to build a longer chain is (0.4/0.6)^6 which is roughly equal to 0.08779. For a 1 in a million chance that the transaction will be reverted, one can wait for 34 confirmations. This is operating under the assumption that 60% of the nodes are behaving honestly and miners have neither been bribed nor are colluding.</p>
<p><strong>Properties of Proof of Work</strong></p>
<p>With particular assumptions proof of work can be argued to be</p>
<ol>
<li><p>reversion resistant</p></li>
<li><p>censorship resistant</p></li>
<li><p>robust.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will analyze these assumptions in the next chapter!</p>
