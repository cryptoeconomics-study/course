# ðŸ‘¾ Coding Project
This repository contains code for the protocols and attacks covered in the Cryptoeconomics.study course. This includes implementing a payment processor blockchain, proof of work, proof of stake, and Plasma.

Much of the code here will be reviewed in online videos which karl.tech and other community members put together. Links to these tutorial videos coming soon!



## Installation

### Beginners

* You're going to need *Node.js* and *npm* to complete these assignments. Install both at once [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

You'll also need a Github account and `git` installed on your computer.

* Create a Github account [here](https://github.com/join).

* Setting up Git:
	* [Download and install the latest version of Git.](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
	* [Set your username in Git.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-username-in-git)
	* [Set your commit email address in Git.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address)
	* [Authenticate with Github from Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git)

### Installation

We're going to be using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) in order to run tests, so install the Mocha package globally by running: 
`npm install -g mocha`

Next, fork [this repository](https://github.com/cryptoeconomics-study/code) ([guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)).
Once you have your own fork at `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/code`, create a local clone of your fork ([guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo#keep-your-fork-synced)).
`cd` into your local clone and run `npm install` to install all of the required dependencies.

## Taking the Course

You'll start off at Section 1.1, so `cd` into Section 1.1 of the Chapter 1 folder `/c1_CentralPaymentOperator/1.1 - Hashes_and_Signatures`. 

Open the `README.md` for instructions on how to complete this part of the coding project. 
You'll be editing the `Client.js` file in the root of this folder to complete this assignment.

 In order to run tests on your work, `cd` into `/test` and run `mocha test.js`. Once you pass all the tests, you can move on to the next section!
 
Don't forget to commit your progress to Github, so we can verify your work and give you a certificate of completion at the end of the course!
