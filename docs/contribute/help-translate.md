Cryptoeconomics.Study is an open source education project that is meant to be used by developers around the world. We need **your** help to make this website more friendly for developers of all languages.

If you can help translate the documentation here into another language, please go to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/cryptoeconomics-study) and pick a language to get started.

Once your translation gets approved, it will appear on this website!
